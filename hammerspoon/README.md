hammerspoon scripts
===================

My init.lua script with bunch of cool commands
used in combination with yabai and Karabiner-Elements.

This setup assumes that you override you CAPS LOCK
key to be treated as a "hyper" key, that is defined
as:

`local hyper  = { "alt", "ctrl", "shift" }`

this means in Karabiner, you assign the CAPSLOCK
to instead work as "alt"+"ctrl"+"shift".

with my mechanical keyboard, where I program the firmware, I also just programmed the actual key
to produce the alt+ctrl+shift combo, and all just works.

NOTE: I left the "./Spoons/*" code for some references
and ideas, but I don't actually use any of that, as
its just a bunch of tiling window manager things
with Hammerspoon, but, yabai is much much better.
